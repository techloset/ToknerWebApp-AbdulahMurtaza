            Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world

            Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
            launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite
            simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
            cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that
            even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers
            and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their
            favorite person and watch their investment as is with other crypto
            currency projects.

            We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the
            "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamifying digital currency,
            bringing in popular faces instead of hard-to-understand projects to
            make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a
            lot of people to finally give this space a real look.
